# Journal

One entry per milestone: what was built, what was measured, what surprised us,
what is still unknown. Kept because the numbers in `design/DESIGN.md` 2 need
provenance, and "we changed our mind about this in week two" is not recoverable
from a diff.

## Milestone 0 — standards, tooling, and the two things a human has to run
2026-08-20

**Built.** `docs/STANDARDS.md` (comment tiers, code rules, review gate),
`pyproject.toml`, dev venv at `~/.venvs/visionhands` (pyenv 3.11.9, pyobjc
12.2.2), `tools/probe_m1_in_td.py`, `tools/record_fixture.py`.

**Measured — new, and it contradicts the spike.** Running the probe standalone
delivered **48 AVFoundation frames in 2.24 s with no run loop turned by us at
all** — a plain `time.sleep()`, in a bare Python process. The spike believed
"AVFoundation delivers frames via the delegate only while a run loop turns"; that
is wrong. `AVCaptureVideoDataOutput` delivers on a GCD dispatch queue, which
needs no run loop. The 28 fps → 8.4 fps collapse recorded in `DESIGN.md` 3 was
therefore *entirely* GIL starvation from the Python polling loop, and nothing to
do with the run loop's presence. `DESIGN.md` 4.2's contingency thread looks
unnecessary. **Not yet confirmed inside TouchDesigner** — that is what the probe
run answers.

Also measured on the standalone control run, consistent with `DESIGN.md` 2:
Vision first call 4279 ms (model load), warm calls 1.70–1.90 ms on a synthetic
720p grey frame, 2.12 ms median on live camera buffers; 1280×720 requested and
1280×720 delivered.

**Surprised us.** `ruff format` cannot be used: it hardcodes two spaces before a
trailing comment, which collapses the aligned annotation column the comment
standard depends on. `ruff check` is the gate instead.

**Still unknown.** Everything the probe exists to answer, in TD's own process:
does pyobjc load next to TD's Objective-C runtime and its own numpy, and does
delivery work there. No fixture clip recorded yet, so no honest performance
number for this repo's own code exists.
